#### Usage

To run them in python (from `~/comphy/`):

    python -m TXX.exXX

Notice that they run as modules, so don't type `.py` at the end
(when you run them).

#### Context

This is a list of the exercises from the Computational Physics lectures at USC
(course 2018/2019) and the programs required to run them in python
(later in C++ and FORTRAN).

Topics 01-06 correspond to the first half of the course;
topics 07-09 correspond to the second half of the course.
