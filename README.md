# comphy

A list of the exercises from the Computational Physics lectures at USC
(course 2018/2019) and the programs required to run them in python (and,
hopefully, later in C++ and FORTRAN).

Note that there is no Lecture_06 because there were no exercises for that day.

Lectures 01 to 12 correspond to the first part of the course.

To run them in python (from `~comphy/`):

    python -m lecture_XX.lecture_XX
