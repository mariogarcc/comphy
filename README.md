This is a list of the exercises from the Computational Physics lectures at USC
(course 2018/2019) and the programs required to run them in python (and,
*hopefully*, later in C++ and FORTRAN).

Note that some lecture numbers may be missing. This is simply because
nothing was lectured that day.

Lectures 01 to 12 correspond to the first part of the course,
while the rest correspond to the second part of the course.

To run them in python (from `~/comphy/`):

    python -m lecture_XX.lecture_XX
